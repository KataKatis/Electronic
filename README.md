# Controlling_mouse_with_joystick

This project is a first electronic's test. You have to connect a joystick (for me the reference is HW-504) on an arduino card (I personnaly use arduino uno). To export data's from serial port I use CoolTermWin, a free software, and I record datas in a text file (it could be coded in python but it is not the subject here).
